            <p><b>Match Report: DC United 3, Queens FC 1 | 2018 MLS Match Recap</b></p>
        <div class="a">
        <p>Wayne Rooney struck for a brace to help lead D.C. United to a 3-1 win over New York City FC and clinched a spot in the Audi 2018 MLS Cup playoffs Sunday at Audi Field.Rooney opened the scoring in the eighth minute, tapping in his team-leading 11th goal of the season after Luciano Acosta danced around three NYCFC defenders to the end line before cutting the ball back to Rooney for his 17th assist of the season.Rooney then helped play provider to Acosta in the 24th minute, holding up a Paul Arriola across and drawing the attention of NYCFC defenders before the ball popped out to the Argentine playmaker, who curled in his 10th goal of the season.The celebration was on in the 74th minute when Rooney converted a penalty kick after Alex Ring handled a ball in the box.
        David Villa pulled NYCFC back a goal in the 78th minute, putting a low shot in off the far post for his 13th goal of the season, but it was too little, too late. </p>
