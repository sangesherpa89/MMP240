    <h1> WIN TICKETS TO WATCH ENGLAND WOMEN AT THE WORLD CUP</h1>
        <p> There is a wonderful prize on offer for Chelsea Women season ticket holders, who can win tickets for you and a friend to watch England in action at next year’s World Cup finals in France. This offer closes this week.
        
         The Belgian has been in sparkling form recently but by his own admission didn’t reach those heights at the London Stadium where we were held to a goalless draw by a dogged West Ham display. In his assessment of yesterday’s match, Hazard brought to mind the corresponding fixture in 2017/18 and ultimately decided a point was a satisfactory outcome this time out.</p>

        <p>The Chelsea contingent at Derby continued their impressive start to the Championship season. Mason Mount (pictured top) and Fikayo Tomori both played the whole game as the Rams recovered well from going behind after just one minute to end the match as 3-1 winners, Mount getting their third goal with a well-placed free-kick. Derby have climbed back into the play-off places.</p>
